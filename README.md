Almost 6.3 million individuals sell on Amazon today, and an astounding 1.5 million people will be active sellers in 2021. As you develop more, you start to care about your data and want to examine your daily transactions, sales, and upcoming orders so that you can manage your stocks more thoroughly. To do this, Amazon has made a data-retrieval API available to his selling Partners.
