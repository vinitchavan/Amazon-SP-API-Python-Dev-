# Amazon-SP-API-Python-Dev-


Almost 6.3 million individuals sell on Amazon today, and an astounding 1.5 million people will be active sellers in 2021. As you develop more, you start to care about your data and want to examine your daily transactions, sales, and upcoming orders so that you can manage your stocks more thoroughly. To do this, Amazon has made a data-retrieval API available to his selling Partners.

This section primarily focuses on how to use an API with the Python programming language and how to store daily transactions.

The datasets for each vendor to run their wearhouse are listed below.

1. Order Data (https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/orders-api-v0-reference)
2. Fullfillment Inbound shipment data (https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/fulfillment-inbound-api-v0-reference)
3. Inventory by country (https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/reports-api-v2021-06-30-reference)
4. Report API (https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/reports-api-v2021-06-30-reference)
5. FBA Customer return (GET_FBA_FULFILLMENT_CUSTOMER_RETURNS_DATA )


In this article, I've broken down how to access the Amazon SP-API, normalise the data, create a daily schedule, and save the data in a database step by step.
